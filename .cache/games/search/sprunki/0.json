        "instructions": "\"Names Decaying Silo!, Short for DS! I'm here to help if you need it! .D\"\nGenderless [She/He/They], 5'7, Sub-Zeros + Velo-City Experiments\nThis map takes place in a missile silo that is situated in a high snowy area. The map is surrounded by a bluish fog and gives off a bluish ambiance from the map's lights. The silo is littered with snow piles and long boxes. It also includes extremely difficult and risky platforming, so the players will need to be extremely careful while traversing through this map.\nDecaying Silo is a community-made Crazy Map created by maxiskips, luxTypes, and Mar_R10Z. It has a total of 7 buttons (4 normal & 3 group) a star rating of 5.7, and is playable in Flood Escape 2.\nThere are 3 easter eggs/secrets hidden in this map.\nThe first one can be found by walking through a can-collide false wall after riding the first zipline. This secret room contains an entire list of honorable map mentions from a fan-game called Liquid Breakout, created by luxTypes. It also contains a moai head, a miniature version of the rocket, and an image of Fopdoodle's EVERY MAP meme.\nThe second secret can be found behind a barricaded door, which is located right after the player makes the second wrap-around and behind a signboard with arrows. Behind the barricaded door is a zipline that takes the player to a gallery area with more honorable map mentions, but based around older 2018-2019 maps. This is now inaccessible.\nThe third and last secret can be found behind a wrap-around after riding the third zipline. It is an extremely transparent text that reads \"I'm going up to Chess Island. I'll see you guys tomorrow.\" This is an inside joke shared among luxTypes's friend group.",
