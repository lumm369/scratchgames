Can't buy a seed when you have enough eggs\nIt's not that the game thinks you don't have enough, but charlie is in the coop and you can't feed her until she gets out of the coop and she's not already eating something. If it still doesn't work, then it is a glitch.\n\n\n2. Nothing happened when the bug is clicked\nThis is also because charlie is laying an egg, wait for her to finish then she can eat, the bug follows the cursor, she won't eat it until she is touching it\n\n3. Mood won't increase/decrease\nIt changed in the hidden \"mood\" variable. The facial expression just didn't change.\n\n4. Charlie won't go to the coop\nCharlie won't go to the coop if you've just bought a seed, and won't go until the food is given to her\n\nCredits:\nart taken from internet\nThe egg is from Minecraft\n(Woulda included sources but twelve year old ytarie5 was freaking dumb and didn't bother)\nused a text engine from @Jirachi7593\nSong is from duck life\nI made basically everything else",
      "instructions": "Only advertise remixes of this project or projects similar to this one. Scroll for instructions vvv\n\nInstructions:\nEvery now and then, charlie the chicken will go into the coop and lay an egg, the smiley face determines charlie's mood. The more the mood drops (It drops fast!), the slower she lays eggs. To boost her mood, you must feed her seeds. A seed costs 5 eggs (They're converted to their value in money before you buy it before you ask) and it will follow your mouse pointer, just drag it to her. If you're low on eggs to buy seeds, occasionally a bug will fly by. You can click on it to feed her. There is a hidden \"egg rate\" variable (hidden as in there being no way to see your current egg rate normally, it's not really meant to be secret...), this changes how many eggs she will lay at the same time; the game will not tell you when it changes, but you can tell what it is if you pay attention to how many eggs your chick is laying at a time (Maybe I'll add a \"ding!\" sound when it changes in the future?). There is a 20% chance of the \"egg rate\" rising when fed a bug (there is no other way to raise it).\n\n#Games #Animations #Art\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n???\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTOP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou probably know about this due to the large amount of people commenting about it, but here's a not-so-secret cheat code.\n\nUp Up, Down Down, Left Right, Left Right, B A",

      "description": "Welcome to the most realistic chicken coop simulator on scratch, currently featuring 10 different breeds of chickens!\n\nFeatured! Yay! :D\n\nUPDATES-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI've added a button that allows you to hide/show chickens to make it easier to collect eggs when you have a lot of chickens. ;)  It also looks a little weird when the chickens are invisible and eggs appear in the nest... O.o\n\nABOUT--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBuild your own flock of chickens starting with one! Collect eggs to earn coins and buy more chickens! Purchase a rooster to hatch chicks! Earn achievements and upgrade your coop with more nests and room for more birds! Collect the rarest breeds and varieties!\n\nGLITCHES-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you experience a glitch, please comment and I will attempt to fix it. In the meantime, try going to the shop, waiting five seconds, and then exiting. In theory, that should temporarily fix any glitches.\n\nKnown Glitches:\n\n-Double Cloning: Lots of chickens appear after leaving the shop. \nI switched the cloning of chickens to a different sprite, instead of         the chicken sprite...hopefully that fixes this.\n-The Return of the Black Pancake: A strange black blob appears instead of chicks. I've made a few changes, so it might be fixed now.\n-The Return of the White Pancake: Cochin eggs turn into white pancakes. I think I've fixed it! ;)\n\nCREDITS------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSounds from the scratch library.\nArt, etc. @b00k_w0rm",

This is the precursor to Scratch Chicken Month! It is based off of a FAMOUS incident from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, in which Link has to go to a village, and there are some chickens running around. It can be PRETTY TEMPTING to hit them with your sword, and if you do a bunch of times, the chicken you hit will scream and call all of his chicken friends to come and attack you! D: Once they start attacking you, they are invincible- you CANNOT DEFEAT THEM. So they are quite literally the hardest enemy in the game. =P\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nAnyway, I hope you enjoy this funny Zeldamation (I might make one about Goron Mountain sometime) and stay tuned for more! :D\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nScratcher of the Project: @Fun_Games\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nQuestion of the Project: What's your favorite animal?\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Link has the same backwards hand as in my previous Zeldamation... o___O",

Waiting for 10,000 views! (As of this post, 9916)\n\nFeb 10, 2020 - Yay! We hit 10K views awesome!\n\nSep 7, 2020 - 250+ hearts and 225+ favorites! Thank you guys for this. It's weird to know that the way most people on the planet know me is as that one guy who made some chickens dance.\n\nOctober 8, 2020 - 40 remixes! oh yeah and also 269 hearts, double nice ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\n\nDecember 10, 2020 - 50 remixes! Still have no idea why. Also, scroll down in the instructions tab ;)\n\nJan 6, 2̶0̶2̶0 2021! - Finally! 2020 is over, pretty epic I wonder what's gonna happen in 2021... anyway, have an amazing new year and hopefully a better year! :)\n\nFeb 3, 2021 - the first time I made one of these (Jan 27, 2020) was over a year ago! back then we just hit 10K views, and now we're at 16K! :)\n\nMay 26, 2021 - Haven't done one of these in a while. It's almost summer and I mostly won't be on Scratch during then, so this might be the last one for a couple of months. Hopefully, it will be at 20K views when I get back ;)  Might also reach 100 remixes soon! (19.2K views and 82 remixes right now) ",

We used a Russian Traditional melody \"Fried Chicken\" for the background music.\nFEATURED! Surprisingly and unexpectedly... Thank you, Scratch! You ask why and how? So do I. If you have some thoughts how to improve the game and make it more interesting, feel free to remix it!\nAnd have a look on my other games. They are cool and funny too.\n",
      "instructions": "A little chicken has just hatched. She is very hungry. In the wide world around her, there are worms crawling, ants running and bees flying. Feed her. Press Left and Right to move the chicken, Space to peck. Each worm gives you 5 score, each ant 10 score. But beware bees. Don't peck when one is around or the bee stings you. Four stings take a life. The game ends successfully when you get 1000 score! Good luck.",

You are limited to 6 shots before a reload. I don't see why the machine fires backwards sometimes though.\nv0.9 Sorting out timing and speed, which is seems to be a major problem in fact.\nv0.10 Walking being worked on, hence why he currently 'hops' in a very peculiar manner!\nv0.11 It walks, though the 'knees' are not entirely convincing. Must look at my trigonometry...\nv0.12 Parking installed.\nv0.13 Now featured, fields included to display the lines / dots and hidden fields\nv0.14 Cloning removed on the joints code, now done purely with lists\nv0.15 Perspective problems resolved, AKA the lasers are now working properly!\nv0.16 Sorting finally managed using a quicksort routine giving a perfect sort and the potential for no clones\nv0.17 Colours now stored using RGB method (thanks @WO997!)",
