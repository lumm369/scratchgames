      "description": "Check out some of my other projects too, I worked hard on some of those!\n\nSome of the art I got off google, and same with the music. The death sound effect I got from @griffpach and his amazing geometry dash, which is probably the most viewed thing on scratch. There's like a 50% chance that you haven't checked him out yet. If you somehow haven't, do so, you won't regret it! Also, I got inspiration from @annoyingtroller and his \"bloodbath challenge wave.\" Also got some more inspiration from @IXPLODE and his \"Geometry Dash Wave.\" You should check him out as well, he's a really good coder from the looks of it! Thanks! Don't forget to like and favorite!!!\n^^ That's beta: v0.9!\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~v0.9.1\nAdded 4 more waves! They look nice~~now there are 10\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n4/24/19 Update! v0.9.2\nI nerfed the obstacle where there are two options: Up or down. This should make the game a lot easier! I also changed the UI slightly.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n5/16/19 ~ 3000 Views! I'm so happy! This is a serous milestone, I think, and this project is huge! (at least compared to my others)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nOkay it's been a bit and I'd say the views went up a bit :0\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ v1.0\n3/30/21 ~ Some major changes, probably the biggest update for a while, or all time; Added a death screen and made the obstacles change colors. The update that I'm most proud of: fixed the wave trail! Now it's smooth and moves at the same speed at the obstacles (it was subtle but it got on my nerves lol) I'm working on a way to restart without clicking the flag again, stay tuned! Remember to leave a star and a heart, and a follow of course! Oh, and also check out my other projects, I make even *more* stupid stuff, if you can believe it.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ v1.0.1\nSame day as above ^ (Just later) I added another difficulty! For everyone who is really good at GD (Unlike me) I gave them a bit of a challenge >:) I haven't added many levels, but they'll be many more coming soon. I'm really happy I've come back to this project, it's looking much better already!\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nI'm working on adding achievements, unlockables, customization, a shop and more! It might not happen though, as I've got a lot of stuff to do in general outside of scratch, sorry :(\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~1.1.2\nI forgot to include this, but I also added a restart screen at some point, plus a menu screen. Also added the music changer and I changed the appearances of the obstacles. Adding that up we're currently at v1.1.2\nComment your high scores in the comment section below! \n\n4/22/21\n25k Views! Big achievement! Thanks for all the support y'all :3 Let's aim for 30k! :D\n\n5/26/21\nthat goal for 30k is just around the corner: we're at 29 thousand 500! :D \n5/26/21\nAnother thing; I'm working on editing the hitboxes for the waves as some people (including me) were asking for. (Plus a settings menu...?) Some stuff may not be working for a lil while I make the changes, I'll try to keep the bugs to a minimum :) \n5/26/21\nI also added a version thingy in the title that way the project looks more professional lmao. but wait a minute isn't that classified as an update...? Time to work on the hitboxes!\n5/27/21\nSmall mistake with the realistic wave turning, but its patched up thanks to @steuerflite7 and @RedFireGD. Another thing to add, the hitbox problem is a lot harder to fix than I originally thought :( I'll try my best to make it happen though! Update: Literally less than five minutes later I realized how to do it ;-; I'll implement it in a second.\nOfficial v1.1.3: Smooth turning + hitbox!\n5/28/21\n200 Stars!! :O\n12/10/21\nv1.1.4: First edit in a million years, made the easy mode easier and hard mode harder. Enjoy :)\nP.S. Sorry for not being active, school's been giving me a lot of trouble, plus finals aren't helping :P Not sure if I'll be active at all really, but I'll be sure to drop by every so often! Thanks for everything :)",
      "instructions": "Give me some feedback and suggestions on new stuff to add in the comments, and follow me for more!\n\n[MINOR SEZURE WARNING FOR IMPOSSIBLE MODE]\nIMPORTANT: If the game freezes when you play, and you instantly die, reload the page (no idea why it happens :/)\nI suggest you don't okay in fullscreen mode it lags a lot for some reason :/\nAlso important: I made a youtube channel, heres the newest vid: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ\nTheres a secret in it, so don't spoil it in the comments!\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nPress 1,2,3,4.....9 and 0 to switch waves in the beginning (there are 10!!), and space to start, like it says. Press/hold space or mouse to go up and down, just like in the game geometry dash! (Personally, I prefer space bar, but that could just be me.) Don't touch the top or bottom of the screen, or the obsticklez or you'll die. It can lag a bit, but if you're having lag issues you can run it on turbo warp, thanks to @Mooshroom-09 heres the link: Turbowarp.org/202395548\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nAdded a low lag mode! Press L at any time to toggle it, and it'll say whether it is on or not. The low lag mode doesn't entirely work :P It just eliminates the particles, which would be the most obvious source of lag. Nobody ever reads to down here, so if you managed to, then comment, \"Gib-a-dib.\"",

(Note: Your name will only be recorded if you are signed in, are not a New Scratcher and complete the level yourself. Also, the automatic player DOES NOT HAVE A 100% SUCCESS RATE, as it depends on your computer's speed.)\n   Low Detail Mode: Cancels out all graphic effects to reduce lag, though it may not entirely prevent lag.\n\nPlease leave a love - I desperately need it.

      "description": "There! Are you happy? Are you finally happy that I changed Dry Out to normal?\n\n5/13/20 - Three new characters added. Partition, GD Colon and me, hoppingicon. Also in Base After Base after the gravity portal ends you no longer need to jump when going back to normal gravity.\n\nEnjoy!\nLoved by @griffpatch_tutor\n\nI tweaked the Your Best a little because people complained about it. However, it doesn't run on cloud and it resets once the flag is clicked.\n\nBasic steps: press z and m to open the editor, and press numbers 1-5 a few times for blocks.\n\nDO NOT REMIX IF YOU DID NOT CHANGE ANYTHING\n\nThe \"your best\" does not work due to no cloud so please stop asking\nMenu and fixed Dry Out are done by @CrystalKeeper7\n\nI changed the levels to Dry Out, Base After Base, and Can't Let Go\n\nI fixed CLG, again and I hope there is no poop crashes like I fixed the glitch where you fall through the blocks and die on a ring\n\nI added right facing spikes\n\n1/27/17 Search suggestion on Google! YAAAAAAAAAY! The more the views, the more people find out!\n\nPS: there are some changes because (most are patched):\n*the cube will float in mid-air\n*the music could become out of sync\n*no anti-gravity (so all upside downs will be right side ups)\n*An invisible grid lines up the blocks so the block and spike jumps are higher (as of 14/6/18 that is fixed)\n\nI know the rings do not work half the time\nI changed the portal texture because it looked different\nI removed cloud score because I messed up that is why your best does not work\nI changed the beacon glow to yellow\n\n\nJumper and Time Machine! --->\nhttps://scratch.mit.edu/projects/120721851/",
      "instructions": "Press [up] [w] [space] [ctrl] [shift] or click to jump and to jump on yellow rings\nAvoid the spikes \nIn ship mode, hold to fly up and release to fly down\nHit a yellow pad to jump high\nHit a blue pad to jump higher (missing a gravity portal)\nFor bonus points, collect the coins\nPress L to toggle effects (to reduce lag)\nPress B to toggle background (can also reduce lag)\n\n\n\"Pretty fun project overall. Base after Base and Can't Let Go can have slightly better mechanics. The backwards portal that is supposed to appear in Dry Out is not there, and the orbs can be buggy at times. Other than that, great job by the creator.\" ~ dylan tang (YouTube)\n\n\"OH YEAH base after base completed with 2 coins on my second try! The music really helps me focus on the game! I mean, I've already beat it a million times on the normal geometry dash but this completion is different... you did a really great job on this game, CrystalKeeper7 and hoppingicon.\" ~ @Bouchard6-12\n\n\"I love this game, I have the actual game on my ipad its so fun. you did a great job on this and you should be proud, i know this is a remix and i find this as a great remake.
