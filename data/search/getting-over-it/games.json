      "description": "THE 4.0 UPDATE HAS RELEASED!! It has a bunch of things like hats, a multiplayer hangout, being able to hear others' sounds, and a lot more! The complete changelog can be found towards the bottom of the Notes and Credits.\n\nThis is a multiplayer version of Griffpatch's Scratch recreation of Getting Over It! Up to eight players can play with each other at once.\n\nCredits and more information about the project such as changelogs and rules can be found ingame - press \"Project Information\" on the main menu!\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nBest played with your web browser in full screen mode (F11) to remove the title-bar - this interferes with the mouse controls when things get frantic - you'll thank me later I promise! (Q+R to reset level)\n\nUse your mouse to control Scratch Cat's hammer. Push, Drag and Throw yourself up the level in your quest to \"Get Over It\".\n\nCONTROLS:\nMouse - Move hammer\nH - Change Hat\nT - Chat\nG - Toggle if player can get pushed\nV - Change name display mode\nSpace (when pressing New Game) - Start in Spectator Mode\n\nIF THE GAME ISN'T LETTING YOU JOIN:\n1) The game could be full - (only 8 people can play at once) - the second server's here: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/405458704\n2) Scratch's servers might not be working at the moment - (there has been a lot more traffic on Scratch recently)\n3) You have the New Scratcher status (you need to be a Scratcher in order to use Cloud Data or play multiplayer games)\n\nThe 4.2 Update Changelog can be found by pressing the Project Information button. (i finally updated it after 2 years lol)\n\n4.0 UPDATE CHANGELOG:\n- Added the MULTIPLAYER HANGOUT! Hang out with your friends and just chill out there!\n- Added HATS! Use the [H] button to cycle through the hats that you can wear.\n- You can now listen to other players' SOUNDS! Sounds are directional so you can hear if they're coming from the left or the right!\n- Added ability to push other players (using the [G] key will disable this for you)\n- TurboWarp is now officially supported! A Scratch account is not needed to play on it however names are randomly generated.\n- Forkphorus is not officially supported as there are still many bugs but you are still able to join if you want.\n- You can now change what other people's names look like by cycling through the options with the [V] key.\n- The color of players are now affected by the time of day so the 1st player isn't always the same color!\n- Updated the title screen to make it look cooler!\n- [BUG FIX] Pressing [T] to open the chat should now automatically select the text input\n\n(Project originally shared on May 17, 2020)\n\n#games #multiplayer #cloud",

Although, I guess remixing a Griffpatch project is a little bit of a cheaty way of getting here. Even so, thanks for playing guys. Scratch on!\n\nIf you're a new player, please use the original project to practice.\n\n@thrat you the bomb\n\nBased on the getting over it mod by Codyumm on \nTwitch / YouTube\n\nv1.1 - Fixed bugs, switched when the lava starts, Fixed leaderboard, added commentary.\n\nv1.2 - added background.\n\nv1.3 - made background show how close the lava is to you- kind of.\n\nv1.4 - fixed background, made slider 1 by default\n\nv1.5 - Added Don't fall mode, currently broken cause my brother legit screaming at me to go to slep ;((((\n\nv1.6 - fixed it ;) and changed how the lava looks\n\nv1.7 - Hopefully the glitch where you keep dying infinitely is fixed\n\nv1.8 - Pausing for a while causes you to die, Should now be fixed\n\nv1.9 - Cloud world record system has now been fixed! Now you can brag to your friends with actual evidence!\n\nv1.10 - Don't fall mode fixed\n\nv2.0 - Fixed infinite die glitch forever, added a neat background at the start, fixed other lava physics!",
